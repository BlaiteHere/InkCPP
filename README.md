# BUT JOHN, WHAT IS THE GAME ABOUT?
 > about

THE GAME WILL REVOLVE ABOUT YOU, HUMAN.
 YOU'LL SEEK SHELTER AND MATERIALS TO
SURVIVE IN HARSH ENVIRONMENT OF NATURE.
 YOU'LL MAKE TOOLS AND FIGHT MONSTERS.
OR YOU WILL BEFRIEND THEM! YOUR CHOICE.
THERE'S NO GOALS. YOU DO WHAT YOU WANT.
  BUILD STRUCTURES, GATHER RESOURCES
# IN THIS POCKET-SIZED 1D ADVENTURE.



# WHAT I'LL BE DOING ASAP
 > aka goals

- make Interaction with Tiles work
 - class type Action with `name` (to display), what the Tile should change to (if it even should), what Item the player has to have equipped to do the action successfully && what `loot_table` to give to the player when the Interaction is successful

- make Inventory and Items work
 - make Items removed from inventory and use them
 - make Tools have `Durability` that will replace `Amount`
 - make Tools have `max_durability` or `max_amount`
 - improve Inventory TUI design

- make Crafting system (recipes, Crafting, Workbench)
 - make Workbench give you access to better recipes

- improve visible chunk/scene design



# FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS PLANNED
 > more abstract goals

- working Inventory & Hand system;
 - working Items
 - working Inventory UI
 - working Item Holding and Usage

- working Crafting system;
 - working Inventory/Crafting UI

- save game to files;
 - saving chunks function
 - saving game essentials to a file

- more GameViewMode support;
 - making all GameViewMode dependant functions execute in one function, so you don't need to go to `getInput()` and `main()` separately when changing one thing

- more Structures: spawned & built;
 - world generation enable spawning structures and looting them (like Statue, Lake)
 - Crafting system giving structures to Inventory and ability to place them (like House, Camp & Farm)
- Enemies & battle system;
 - ability to defeat Enemies in a battle
 - ability to calm Enemies & exit battling
 - making Enemies give you resources if befriended or defeated
